#BetoFilho: The Game
###[NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT]

Created in October - 2014, BetoFilho was my first attemp at Unity Engine. By this time, I only knew HTML5 (Canvas + Javascript) and Game Maker (plus GML). I learned both C# and Unity itself together, so this code isn't really documented at all (and there is no pattern for variables etc).

The development of BetoFilho ended in March of 2015 when my external hard-drive fell from my hand and corrupted one of the core scripts of the game ("newPlayer.cs"). I could recover the rest of the project, but this file was broken. Also, there was no backup of the project, neither builds. Was my very first Unity game lost forever?

The answer is no. Although it was a pain to do, I rewrote this core file trying to remember how I did it at the first time (near 2 years ago) and it works! It's not the same as the original, but it works. So and releasing the source-code, because it's cool and I like to remember how everything started.

BetoFilho is basically a FPS/TPS playground with vehicles (Helicopter, Car and Aircraft), a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher.

DESPITE being buggy, feel free to clone or do whatever you want with this repo.
I don't think anyone would be interested, anyway, you can.

RIP BetoFilho, 2014-2015.
